# Brain Tumor Classification with MRI Images

### Project Report
https://github.com/1minute99/Brain-Tumor-Classification/blob/main/main.ipynb

### Objective
Building a Machine Learning Model that can classify brain tumor with MRI images.

### Outcome
The model built using transfer learning shows almost excellent accuracy with 97.77% and the CNN model also shows good accuracy.

### About the data
- The images are separated by astrocytoma, carcinoma, ependymoma, ganglioglioma, germinoma, glioblastoma, granuloma, medulloblastoma, meningioma, neurocytoma, oligodendroglioma, papilloma, schwannoma and tuberculoma.
- A private collection of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, and T2 magnetic resonance images separated by brain tumor type.
- Images without any type of marking or patient identification, interpreted by radiologists and provided for study purposes.

### Data Source
- The dataset is from kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Images 44 Classes dataset.
